    <p>With it being Fatherâ€™s Day and all I thought a manly recipe was in order. And whatâ€™s more manly than gnawing meat off of bones?</p>
    <p>Actually with these Jack Danielâ€™s Ribs, a copycat of TGI Fridayâ€™s ribs, thereâ€™s not much gnawing involved. They are fall off the bone tender.</p>

    <p>Ribs are a favorite of just about every dad that Iâ€™ve met. Baste on a Whiskey-flavored BBQ sauce and youâ€™ve won major bonus points. These are some ribs that are meant to impress. Bu thereâ€™s no need to slave over a hot grill, beads of sweat dripping down your brow.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve got it easy with this recipe girls. After being rubbed with a spice mixture, the ribs slow cook in the oven, during which time they need no attention whatsoever.</p>
    <p>Just a few minutes on the grill finishes them off with a nice sear and some grill marks. They donâ€™t get basted with the sauce until they are finished to keep the sugar in the sauce from burning. Theyâ€™re fully cooked by the time you grill them so no need to worry about whether or not they have been on the grill long enough.</p>
    <p>The sauce does take some time to make because you have to roast a head of garlic for an hour before you make it. You might want to go ahead and roast an extra head and make some garlic bread to go with the ribs. Just an idea ðŸ™‚</p>
    <p>Then the sauce takes a while to cook down and if you cook it until it gets nice and thick, there is not a whole lot of it, around 1 cup. You may want to make extra if you like your ribs really doused in sauce. With sweet flavors from pineapple and roasted garlic and a little kick from some whiskey and cayenne pepper, it is one lip smacking sauce.</p>
    <p>Serve with some Buttermilk Coleslaw,  Root Beer Baked Beans, and Roasted Corn for a meal dad will enjoy all summer long.</p>
