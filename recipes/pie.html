    <h1>No-Bake Lemon Cream Cheese Pie</h1>
    <p>This no-bake Lemon Cream Cheese Pie is one of my favorite desserts. It’s super creamy, brightened up with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and a cinch to make!</p>

    <p>As a child, I can remember my mom making this pie for picnics and family gatherings. She didn’t normally add lemon to the cream cheese mixture, but instead would top it with canned blueberry or cherry pie topping.</p>
    <p>I love my mom’s way of making it, but I tweaked it to create this Lemon Cream Cheese Pie recipe, which has a bright citrus flavor like Homemade Lemon Meringue Pie. It turned out delicious and it’s become a recipe I make regularly for family gatherings!</p>

    <h2>No-Bake Lemon Cream Cheese Pie Recipe</h2>
    <p>I can’t forget to mention that this is a no-bake Lemon Cream Pie, which means it’s oh-so-easy to make! You can use a simple homemade graham cracker crust (I share my recipe below!) or a store-bought crust. Then, you just stir together the filling ingredients and chill the pie for three or four hours, or until it has set.</p>
    <p>With sour cream, cream cheese, and whipped topping, you know this Lemon Cream Cheese Pie is super creamy, but the addition of lemon is a nice counterbalance to all that richness so it doesn’t feel like a heavy dessert. You can garnish it with additional Cool Whip, fresh lemon slices, candied lemon peel, or keep it simple with a dusting of powdered sugar!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients For No-Bake Lemon Cream Cheese Pie</h2>
    <ul>For the crust:
        <li>Graham cracker crust</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>For the fillings:
        <li>Philadelphia Cream Cheese – To make the filling easier to mix, let the cream cheese sit on the countertop for 30 to 45 minutes so it softens a bit.</li>
        <li>Cool Whip</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Freshly-squeezed lemon juice – Try making this recipe with lime juice instead for something different!</li>
        <li>Lemon zest – I recommend using a fine zester so you don’t get big pieces of lemon peel in the creamy filling.</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p>What is lemon pie filling made of?</p>
    <p>This Lemon Cream Cheese Pie is a little bit different from a typical lemon pie; the filling is made with sour cream, cream cheese, whipped topping, lemon, and sugar. This makes it much easier to whip up than a traditional lemon cream pie!</p>
    <p>How do you juice a lemon without a juicer?</p>
    <p>You don’t need a juicer to juice a lemon! Simply cut it into quarters, then squeeze the juice into a bowl. Remove any seeds, then use the juice in the recipe. (Have a leftover lemon after making this recipe? Here’s how to use half a lemon!)</p>
    <p>Do you eat lemon pie warm or cold?</p>
    <p>This Lemon Cream Cheese Pie should be eaten chilled. Don’t warm it up—the filling will melt!</p>
